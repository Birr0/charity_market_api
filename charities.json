        "missionStatement": "Alexander Jansons was a fun-loving, football mad young man who died suddenly and unexpectedly from myocarditis. He was 18. At the time, there was no where for his family to get information so the charity was  founded to raise awareness and fund research so that we can save lives and stop any family from experiencing what the Jansons family had to endure with no answers and no information. We are committed to raising funds but having fun along the way to pay tribute to fine young man who was taken too soon.",
